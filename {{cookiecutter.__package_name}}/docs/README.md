# Folder for hosting all documents for a Data Science Project

Documents will contain information about the following:

## acceptance
Contains all the details of the project that are useful for learning about how to operate the system.

## business_understanding
The charter document is a living document. You update the template throughout the project as you make new discoveries and as business requirements change. The key is to iterate upon this document, adding more detail, as you progress through the discovery process. Keep the customer and other stakeholders involved in making the changes and clearly communicate the reasons for the changes to them.

## media

## modeling

## references

## src

## system_architecture
